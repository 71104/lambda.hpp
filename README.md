Lambda
======

Lambda expressions implementation for C++0x and higher, very similar to [Boost Lambda](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_54_0/doc/html/lambda.html).

This implementation uses the following C++0x features:
- rvalue references,
- variadic template arguments,
- return type inference.

Made mainly for fun.
